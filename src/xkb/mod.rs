/// A number used to represent a physical key on a keyboard.
///
/// A standard PC-compatible keyboard might have 102 keys.  An appropriate
/// keymap would assign each of them a keycode, by which the user should
/// refer to the key throughout the library.
///
/// Historically, the X11 protocol, and consequentially the XKB protocol,
/// assign only 8 bits for keycodes.  This limits the number of different
/// keys that can be used simultaneously in a single keymap to 256
/// (disregarding other limitations).  This library does not share this limit;
/// keycodes beyond 255 ('extended keycodes') are not treated specially.
/// Keymaps and applications which are compatible with X11 should not use
/// these keycodes.
///
/// The values of specific keycodes are determined by the keymap and the
/// underlying input system.  For example, with an X11-compatible keymap
/// and Linux evdev scan codes (see linux/input.h), a fixed offset is used:
///
/// let keycode_A: Keycode = KEY_A + 8;

/// A number used to represent the symbols generated from a key on a keyboard.
///
/// A key, represented by a keycode, may generate different symbols according
/// to keyboard state.  For example, on a QWERTY keyboard, pressing the key
/// labled \<A\> generates the symbol 'a'.  If the Shift key is held, it
/// generates the symbol 'A'.  If a different layout is used, say Greek,
/// it generates the symbol 'Î±'.  And so on.
///
/// Each such symbol is represented by a keysym.  Note that keysyms are
/// somewhat more general, in that they can also represent some "function",
/// such as "Left" or "Right" for the arrow keys.  For more information,
/// see:

/// several modifiers, and a modifier may be activated by several keys.
/// Different keymaps do this differently).

    /// active, so it is not consumed by this translation.

    /// It may be desirable for some application to not reuse consumed modifiers
    /// for further processing, e.g. for hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts. To
    /// understand why, consider some requirements from a standard shortcut
    /// mechanism, and how they are implemented:
    ///
    /// 1. The shortcut's modifiers must match exactly to the state. For example,
    ///    it is possible to bind separate actions to \<Alt\>\<Tab\> and to
    ///    \<Alt\>\<Shift\>\<Tab\>. Further, if only \<Alt\>\<Tab\> is bound to
    ///    an action, pressing \<Alt\>\<Shift\>\<Tab\> should not trigger the
    ///    shortcut.
    ///    Effectively, this means that the modifiers are compared using the
    ///    equality operator (==).
    /// 2. Only relevant modifiers are considered for the matching. For example,
    ///    Caps Lock and Num Lock should not generally affect the matching, e.g.
    ///    when matching \<Alt\>\<Tab\> against the state, it does not matter
    ///    whether Num Lock is active or not. These relevant, or significant,
    ///    modifiers usually include Alt, Control, Shift, Super and similar.
    ///    Effectively, this means that non-significant modifiers are masked out,
    ///    before doing the comparison as described above.
    /// 3. The matching must be independent of the layout/keymap. For example,
    ///    the \<Plus\> (+) symbol is found on the first level on some layouts,
    ///    and requires holding Shift on others. If you simply bind the action
    ///    to the \<Plus\> keysym, it would work for the unshifted kind, but
    ///    not for the others, because the match against Shift would fail. If
    ///    you bind the action to \<Shift\>\<Plus\>, only the shifted kind would
    ///    work. So what is needed is to recognize that Shift is used up in the
    ///    translation of the keysym itself, and therefore should not be included
    ///    in the matching.
    ///    Effectively, this means that consumed modifiers (Shift in this example)
    ///    are masked out as well, before doing the comparison.
    ///
    /// state_modifiers are the modifiers reported by
